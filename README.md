Blockchain
This repository contains a basic implementation of a blockchain in Python, designed as a learning tool to understand the core concepts of blockchain technology. It demonstrates how blocks are created, chained, and validated using cryptographic hashing, with a simple proof-of-work mechanism.
Features

Block Structure: Each block contains an index, timestamp, transactions, proof, and a hash of the previous block.
Proof-of-Work: A simple consensus algorithm requiring miners to find a nonce that produces a hash with a specified number of leading zeros.
Decentralized Network: Basic node registration and consensus algorithm to ensure all nodes agree on the same chain.
HTTP Interface: Uses Flask to provide RESTful endpoints for interacting with the blockchain (e.g., adding transactions, mining blocks, and retrieving the chain).
ERC-20 Compatibility: The blockchain supports token transactions compatible with ERC-20 standards, allowing integration with standard wallets.

Prerequisites

Python 3.6 or higher
pip for installing dependencies
An HTTP client like Postman or curl for testing endpoints

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/Trytonottry/Blockchain.git
cd Blockchain


Install the required Python packages:pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure you have the following dependencies:
Flask
requests



Usage

Run the Flask server to start a blockchain node:
python app.py

The server will run on http://localhost:5000 by default.

Interact with the blockchain using the following endpoints:

GET /chain: Retrieve the full blockchain.
POST /transactions/new: Add a new transaction. Example payload:{
  "sender": "address1",
  "recipient": "address2",
  "amount": 5
}


GET /mine: Mine a new block by solving the proof-of-work puzzle.
POST /nodes/register: Register new nodes. Example payload:{
  "nodes": ["http://localhost:5001", "http://localhost:5002"]
}


GET /nodes/resolve: Run the consensus algorithm to ensure the node has the longest valid chain.


Test the endpoints using an HTTP client like Postman or curl. For example:
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/chain



Project Structure

app.py: Main Flask application with blockchain logic and HTTP endpoints.
blockchain.py: Core blockchain class implementing block creation, proof-of-work, and consensus.
requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies.

How It Works

Blocks: Each block is a record containing transactions, a timestamp, and a proof. Blocks are linked via hashes, ensuring immutability.
Proof-of-Work: Miners must find a nonce that, when hashed with the blockâ€™s data, produces a hash with a specified number of leading zeros.
Consensus: Nodes resolve conflicts by adopting the longest valid chain in the network, ensuring all nodes agree on the blockchain state.
Decentralization: Nodes communicate via HTTP to share transactions, blocks, and node lists, simulating a decentralized network.
